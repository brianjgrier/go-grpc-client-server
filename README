# This is a simple test to show how to create and use gRPC in place of REST or SOAP
#
# I have structued this as a typical go program, though it is so simple it could have been
# placed in a single directory.
#
# This includes how to use:
#   1) a common module for variables
#   2) a protobuf file
#   3) a Makefile to pull it all together
#
# You will need to have installed some version of 'go' and a version of 'protoc' that is 
# compatible with your version of 'go'
#
# If you are building this on a Windows PC AND you want to use VSCode you will need two 
# 'go' compilers installed. The first is for Ubuntu in your WSL installation and the second 
# is for VSCode. Both should be the same version to avoid problems.
